<h2>Custom event binding demo</h2>

<hr />
<!-- 
  This approach is not an idiomatic one. Because: 
  1.  Any expression scope in the template forbids assignment, mutation, 
      and creation (use of = or new keyword is forbidden in templates)
  2.  Complex event args may not be constructed in the template for reason 1
  3.  Even if reason 1 is no applicable, writing long logical blocks 
      in the template goes against the separation of concerns principle

  I have written this code for demonstration, 
  will refactor it in the next branch - Vivek

<button
  class="btn btn-primary"
  (click)="customEvent.emit({ message: 'Emitting from child at button click' })"
>
  Emit Custom Event
</button>
